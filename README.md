## Overview

Dozyo is a frictionless productivity coach designed to help students and early-career professionals overcome procrastination by breaking down their tasks into ultra-simple micro-steps, nudging them at the right moments, and eventually turning distraction into a point of re-engagement via mobile.

## Features

### üß† Frictionless Task Entry
- One-line freeform task input
- GPT-assisted micro-task breakdown (e.g., "Open doc," "Write 1 sentence")
- Intuitive UI with warm, encouraging design

### ‚ö° Smart Nudges
- Optional "nudging hours" (user selects preferred time window)
- GPT-generated motivational micro-prompts
- Web notifications for gentle reminders

### üîÅ Micro-Task Tracker
- Check off small steps to build momentum
- "Next micro-task" always visible and achievable in < 2 minutes
- Encouraging confetti/message after each step

### üìä Streaks & Soft Gamification
- Gentle streak tracker (no guilt for missing a day)
- Daily "Just Do One" prompt
- Small motivational badges (e.g., "3-Day Streak," "First Step!")

## Tech Stack

## Design Philosophy

Dozyo follows a "warm coach" approach to productivity, with:
- Warm, pastel color palette
- Rounded corners and soft shadows
- Friendly, encouraging microcopy
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Quicksand font for approachable feel

## Phase 2 (Mobile App)

Future plans include:
- Background detection of common distraction apps (YouTube, Instagram)
- Subtle intervention: "Want to earn 1 point? Do one micro-task first?"
- Instant rewards (confetti, sound, XP) for redirecting effort
- Offline-first task completion tracking
